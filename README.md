# Existing WordPress site development - Docker

Expanded from [https://github.com/lumonald/existing-wordpress-development-docker](https://github.com/lumonald/existing-wordpress-development-docker). Minor changes to ports, and addition of phpMyAdmin.

Quickly creates a local development environment for an *existing* WordPress site. 

This application requires Docker to be up and running and for docker compose to also be installed.

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines 2 containers - 

* `wordpress` - for the website files.
* `db` - for the associated MySQL database.

In addition, `docker-compose-phpmyadmin.yml` starts a phpMyAdmin interface to interact with the database.
To run this alongside the site, use e.g:

	docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-phpmyadmin.yml up 

The `wordpress` container has 2 volumes - 

1. The `site/wp-content` folder - Copy the `wp-content` folder from the production site. It's used for all customisations outside of the core WordPress code. This includes the themes, plugins, uploads etc.

2. `init/prep.sh` - Disables plugins as defined in the `.env` file. It also makes the `wp-content` folder the same owner/group as the rest of the site.

**Note:** The `wp-config.php` file gets auto generated for this local WordPress instance.

The `db` container has 3 volumes - 

1. `database` - A folder for all of the MySQL files, this gets automatically generated by docker and can remain untouched for average usage.

2. `mysqldumps/backup.sql.gz` - This is a snapshot taken from the production instance via mysqldump, place the file in this location and it will get imported on the first run of the container automatically.

3. `init/migrate.sh` - A URL migration script, this updates the URL stored in the database, this also gets run automatically when the containers are spun up for the first time. 

## Usage
1. Clone or download this project.

2. Create a mysqldump from your pre-existing site and place in location: `mysqldumps/backup.sql.gz` (ensure file is named `backup.sql.gz`)

3. Obtain copy of `wp-content` folder from pre-existing site and place in location: `site/wp-content`

4. Copy `env-template` as `.env` and enter your configuration variables. 

5. Navigate to the root of this project locally and run:

	docker-compose up -d && docker-compose exec wordpress prep.sh

6. For additional insight into the database, optionally run _phpMyAdmin_ with:

	docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-phpmyadmin.yml up

The website will then be available at `http://localhost:8000` and the WordPress dashboard at `http://localhost:8000/wp-admin`. __phpMyAdmin__ is set to `http://localhost:8001`
